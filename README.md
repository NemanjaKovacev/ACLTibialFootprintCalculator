# ACLTibialFootprintCalculator

An app which improves the outcome of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.

This app utilizes a new formula developed in my doctoral dissertation. 

This formula enables orthopedic surgeons to accurately predict the size of the ACL tibial footprint
by using just two preoperative X-ray parameters - anteroposterior and mediolateral diameter of the tibial plateau.
